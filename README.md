# Technic'n'Survival
Technic'n'Survival (TNS) is a modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2 offering an advanced survival experience with some cool tech features.

With this quite small modpack, you will find all the great technical mods like Applied Energistics 2, Immersive Engineering, Mekanism, Thermal, and Advanced Rocketry.

But also some mods making the survival experience and the exploration a bit more realistic and interesting like Tough as Nails, Spice of Life: Carrot Edition, Realistic Terrain Generator, Serene Seasons, Biomes O'Plenty, and the whole solar system as additional dimensions! ðŸš€
